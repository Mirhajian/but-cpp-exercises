# This is just a recall

This part is a recall to the basics of the C++ that the studets have studied before
Chapters: (list will update until the end of this semester)

- 1. Vectors
- 2. Recursive Functions
- 3. Call by value / reference

The chapters here are only decided by the studets, they either didn't understad them quite well or they just don't remember.
